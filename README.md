My e-commerce platform, built using React.js. 

<br>

<b>13-08-2024 13:08</b> - <p>THIS PROJECT, WHILE POSING AS A BASIC REACT.JS-BASED E-COMMERCE PLATFORM, MAINLY ACTS AS A PARODY OF THE THEORIES SURROUNDING THE DARK WEB, AND THE BLACK MARKET.</p>
<p><b>ALL "PRODUCTS" IN THIS PROJECT ARE IMAGINARY.</b></p>
<p><b>RESEMBLANCE TO ANY REAL-LIFE ELEMENTS, ACTIVE OR DEFUNCT IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.</b></p>

<br>

<p>This README file will document the entire progress of building this personal/passion project.</p>

<br>

<b>20-08-2024 18:22</b> - <p>The Navbar, header announcement and basic product list has been constructed onto the React App. Images of product "cards" were integrated as online image links, instead of local images, to avoid errors.</p>

<br>

<b>12-09-2024 12:49</b> - <p>The <b>Login section</b> construction is complete, although it is not connected to the homepage. The purpose of the section is to just demonstrate the credentials authentication process, albeit without any redirecting. The Signup section is still unbuilt.</p>
